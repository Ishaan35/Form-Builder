# Form Builder

## COMMERCIAL PROJECT

This is a planned commercial project for a company I am working for. I cannot make my code publicly visible, however, there is a video that shows the project. 

## About

This is a full-stack application created with the React JS framework (front-end) and Node JS (back-end). I used Javascript, HTML, CSS, MySQL (for the database), and Amazon Web Services (hosting static files). This web application allows users to create dynamic forms with an interactive user interface. Users can create dynamic forms with several types of inputs such as text, paragraph, radio, checkbox, and files. 

The user can make these forms public to start accepting responses and share the link with others. Users must create an account to create and share forms, however, a user does not need to be signed up to answer forms created by other users. These forms have an option to be password protected as well, in case the creator wants to make sure only select people with the password are able to submit responses. 

The creator of the form is able to make changes to the form, view responses, delete responses, and delete the form itself.

Additionally, every user who is signed up with an account on this website is able to modify their personal information collected during registration and customize their profile with a profile picture.
